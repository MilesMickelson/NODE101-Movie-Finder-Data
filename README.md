# Node101-Movie-Finder-Data

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

Second project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School. Utilizes Axios module to make an API call
to an online movie data base after it has checked a server side data cache to see if it is there first, 
if it is not the call will be made and that data will be stored to save future requests to the API.

#### Please feel free to review the code in this repository as there is no front end feature to visualize.

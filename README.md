# Node101-Movie-Finder-Data

Second project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School. Utilizes Axios module to make an API call
to an online movie data base after it has checked a server side data cache to see if it is there first, 
if it is not the call will  be made and that data will be stored to save requests to the API.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
